The Coming Soon modules allows you to easily add a coming soon page to your website, with a fully responsive template, that can customize to fit your needs, from changing the background to adding the collect of subscribers system.

This module keeps the user login page accessible, so admins can log in and keep working on the site freely. While all other anonymous visitors will be redirected to the coming soon page as long as the "end date" - which is configurable in the back office - is greate then the actual date.

As mentioned above, the coming soon module allows you to add a form to collect subscriptions from visitors who wishes to get notified once the website is online.
